Intro to Github

Hello Everyone!!!

I'm kinda new to Github. I recently graduated from Biola University studying applied mathematics.

I have a little experience building and revising programs in C++ as well as coding in R and Matlab. I've practiced SQL and HTML/HTML5 online so I have a little experience writing SQL queries and building web pages. And, of course, like most people I have experience in MS Word/Excel/Powerpoint/ and a little Access. Lastly, I just finished working for a company where each day I used Windows GP, Adobe, and MS Excel.

I consider myself a beginner at coding, although I have experience mostly from university projects.

I hope to grow here at GitHub in skill and intellect, and hopefully I'll get noticed by a recruiter and land a job.
